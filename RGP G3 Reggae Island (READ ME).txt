It has come to our attention that the previously used title for the piece "Reggae Island" does not fit in with our values as an organisation. We would like to apologise for any offence caused through this title, which has now been changed to "Reggae Island". 

The MP3s have been edited and renamed accordingly. 

Please use the files named "RGP G3 Reggae Island" which can be found within this download.
